	?3. temperature: 0.6: Controls the randomness of the generated output, with higher values producing more random responses.

	?4. max_tokens: 250: Limits the length of the generated completion to a maximum of 250 tokens.

	?5. top_p: 1: Sets the cumulative probability threshold for the generated tokens, ensuring that the response is within the specified probability.

	?6. frequency_penalty: 1: Adjusts the penalty applied to frequently used tokens, reducing their likelihood in the generated response.

	?7. presence_penalty: 1: Controls the penalty applied to infrequently used tokens, encouraging their inclusion in the generated completion.
